Hiya! ðŸ‘‹

This is naughts and crosses featuring a player and a hard coded AI.
The AI makes decisions based on the state of the board - it is not a developing system.

I took inspiration from another 'Tic Tac Toe' Python program that I saw, but NONE of the code is spliced or directly taken.

The code is commented heavily and probably includes some of my thoughts when I was writing the code.
GLHF!

# Strings are also easier to read and sometimes easier
# to work with.
